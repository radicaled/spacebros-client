# spacebros-client

A client for the inappropriately named [spacebros](https://github.com/radicaled/spacebros) project.

It's built in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), a free, open source game engine.

# FAQ

## Why not Unity?

Anyone can download and install Godot, on all three major platforms, with no registration required. The same can't be said of Unity or Unreal Engine 4.

Since this is an open source project, it'd be best if all the tools required to work on it were also open source.
